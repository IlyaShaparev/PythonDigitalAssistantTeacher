### Introduction :notebook:

Hello!
The Digital Assistant Teacher (hereinafter DAT) is a new system developed by our university in order to simplify the study of Python and its capabilities. Students receive their own, unique generated set of 11 tasks. Everyone needs to write a software solution to the received exercises and send a task for testing. Here I want to present my solution to the problems, because they seemed very interesting to me, and it took a lot of time to solve some of them (without having knowledge in the required module or area).
